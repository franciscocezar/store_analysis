# Indicators Automation

### Objective: Train and create a complete project involving the automation of a process done in the computer

### Description:

Imagine you work in a large chain of clothing stores with 25 stores spread all over Brazil.

Every day, in the morning, the data analysis team calculates the so-called OnePages and sends them to the manager of each store, along with all the information used to calculate the indicators.

A OnePage is a very simple and straight to the point summary, used by the store management team to know the main indicators of each store and allow in 1 page (hence the name OnePage) both the comparison between different stores, and which indicators that store managed to meet that day or not.

Your role, as a Data Analyst, is to be able to create a process as automatically as possible to calculate each store's OnePage and send an email to each store's manager with their OnePage in the body of the email and also the complete file with their respective store's data attached.
